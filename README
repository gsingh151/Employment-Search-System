How to run program

Run Main class. Pick choices that are shown in () by entering the valid number. There are 5 types of users that can use
this program:
1) Applicant: Can apply for job postings
2) Company: Create job postings
3) HRCoordinator: Oversees their company's job postings
4) Interviewer: Interviews applicants and submits decision to accept or reject applicants
5) Referee: Submit letters of references for applicants

All 5 user types are child classes of abstract class User. Each of these classes has a manager class (deals with methods
that has to do with all instances of that class as it contains an array list of them) and an interface class (deals with
the user interface of each class as each class has different possible actions and also deals with different information).

Upon creating an account. Make sure you remember your username and password (your username will be name + id and your
password cannot be empty like "").

The 2 extra features are:
1) Adding a new user type called referee
2) Implementing a notification system

JobPosting class represents a job posting and InterviewFormat represents its round system. This is by far the biggest
change made from phase 1 to phase 2 as:
1) The entire JobPosting class was re-implemented (the only things that weren't changed were the names of the methods)
2) The round system was refined for phase 2 by creating a separate class from it as well as changing the way nextRound()
method worked.

How the code works:
1) Welcomed by Main.welcome()
2) Login or create a new account(Automatically login when new account is created)
3) Redirected to (Child_of_User_class)Interface.MainMenu()
4) Selects action
5) IF action is logout then go to step 1) else complete action and then automatically go to step 3).
